# Smart Walking Cane for Indoor Navigation for the Visually Impaired

### Introduction and Project Overview
This is our project for the course ```Mobile Robotics```, made by Lyeba Abid, Ali Muhammad Asad, Sadiqah Mushtaq, and Syed Muhammad Ali Naqvi under the supervision of Dr. Basit Memon.

At the heart of the project is the development of a simulation using ```Gazebo```, integrated with ```ROS``` as a middleware, and ```MATLAB Simulink```. Our focus is on crafting an autonomous mobile robot in the form of a cane that serves not just as a navigational aid but also as a beacon of independance for visually impaired individuals. 
<em>*For the purpose of simulation, the navigation cane is modelled as a wheeled mobile robot - the Gazebo Turtlebot serves as a model which acts as an assistive cane in our case.</em>

### The Challenge and Our Solution
Navigating through unfamiliar indoor environments poses a significant challenge for people with visual impairments. Traditional aids like canes or guide dogs, while helpful, have limitations in terms of autonomy and efficiency. Our project aims to transcend these boundaries by harnessing the power of modern robotics.

Our solution is a smart walking cane, a robotic guide that offers the dual functionality of a traditional cane and an intelligent navigational assistant. This autonomous robot is designed to guide the user through complex environments, ensuring the shortest, safest path to their desired destination. By avoiding obstacles and navigating efficiently, the cane promises a new level of independence and safety for its users.

<!-- This is our project for the course Mobile Robotics made by Lyeba Abid, Ali Muhammad Asad, Sadiqah Mushtaq, and Syed Muhammad Ali Naqvi, under the supervision of Dr. Basit Memon. This project aims to develop a simulation on Gazebo, using ROS and MATLAB Simulink to develop a simulation on an autonomous wheeled mobile robot that can help the visually impaired navigate through different settings with ease and efficiency. 

Navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces can be an incredibly challenging task for individuals with visual impairments, as they often rely on canes, guide dogs, or verbal directions from others. Our motivation for this project is to provide a more independent and efficient solution, leveraging advanced robotics to assist visually impaired individuals in finding the shortest and safest path to their destination while avoiding obstacles along the way. In this project, the user will hold the robot, which will not only act as a guide but also serve as a walking cane, ensuring a smooth and reliable journey.
